		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>This is the first website I have created for IS601. The purpose of this website is to familiarize myself with using git. Another objective of it is to help me grow accustomed to using Linux and Vi commands. Below are some of the commands that I used during the creation process.</p>
		<h3>Linux Commands</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> pwd = Show Current Directory
			<li> ls = Directory Listing
			<li> cd = Change Directory
			<li> mkdir = Make Directory
		</ul>
